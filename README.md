#Fresh Tomatoes 


##What is it?

Fresh tomatoes is a website where you can view movies released in the last week. 
Each movie has associated details such as overview, average
popularity vote and release date. The movie trailer can be viewed by clicking on the
poster or 'view trailer' button. Movie data is refreshed daily.

At the moment only the first 20 movies released in the previous week are displayed.

##Disclaimer:

This website utilises the TMDb API to retrieve the movie data but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

Javascript extensively adapted from the Udacity sample project fresh_tomatoes.py

##How to run Fresh Tomatoes:

 python entertainment_center.py

##Release plans:

At the moment this program is tightly bound to the TMDb API so some more steps are necessary
to remove this dependence, in case a move to a different API should be necessary
